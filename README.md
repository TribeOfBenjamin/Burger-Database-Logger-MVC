# Burger-Logger
This app lets you keep track of the burgers you've eaten. Once a burger has been eaten, clicking the button will move its name to the other side of the screen so you can clearly see the fruits of your labor. You can add new burgers to the list by using the submit form. The app is connected to a MySQL database which keeps track of which burgers you have and haven't ate.
